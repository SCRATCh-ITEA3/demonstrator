System Requirements 

Functional Requirements 

SGD Management 
The management of SGD is decentralized and out of scope of this document
SR.SGD.Management.documentation 
SGD-1.0-SR001
There shall be a description how the management of firmware updates is regulated, roles and responsibilities mentioned in this description should be implemented in the software
 
Table 1 example of rights structure for a certain demonstrator
Clusters	Clarification
SGD rights	 
Firmware update push	Device manufacturer when specified in policy
Firmware update pull	IoT device owner, based on manufacturer message
Provisioning new device	IoT device owner.
Blocking IoT device	System based on detection of certain event
  
Acceptance Criteria:
•	An instance of the SGD shall have a management policy with associated rights structure.

SR.SGD.Management.asset
SGD-1.0-SR002
The Gateway shall have a method and policy to control which device can be connected and by which protocols it is allowed to communicate.  
 Acceptance Criteria:
•	Whether a device has a connection with a gateway is determined by a white list and the communication policy associated with the device.
•	The device/whitelist can be queried and adjusted by a secure management function.
•	Non registered devices should be rejected and the attempt logged if so, indicated by the policy

SR.SGD.Management.asset.sandbox
SGD-1.0-SR003
If non secure or unencrypted sensors are allowed to connect to the gateway, this connection should be handled as non-safe and sandboxed
 
Acceptance Criteria:
•	It shall be possible to set a connect all policy, only when the gateway can sandbox the connection of non-whitelisted devices.
•	The data handling of non-whitelisted devices should be isolated and have no access to critical functionality of the gateway.
•	By default, all non-registered devices shall be blocked unless.

SR.SGD.Management.asset.provisioning
SGD-1.0-SR004
It shall be possible to whitelist a device remotely. The registration should be possible also during installation of the new device. (related to SGD-1.0-SR001)
 
Acceptance Criteria:
•	It shall be possible to create a whitelisted device entry remotely
•	If a device tries to register and is not whitelisted, a secure mechanism should be in place to register the device immediately.

SR.SGD.Management.asset.disabeling
SGD-1.0-SR005
It shall be possible to block a connected device based on a policy or set of behavioral criteria. (related to SGD-1.0-SR001)
 
Acceptance Criteria:
•	It shall be possible to monitor a set of predefined behavioral characteristics of a device
•	It shall be possible to disable a device
•	When its behavior is outside the policy set for it
•	When a device is blocked an alert will be generated
•	Upgrading software or firmware of a device without this being checked by the gateway is in all circumstances malicious behavior and will lead to blocking/ decommissioning the device.

SR.SGD.User.Management
SGD-1.0-SR006
There shall be a user management function for adding, editing, disabling of users that have access to the configuration parts of the gateway. (related to SGD-1.0-SR001)
Acceptance Criteria:
•	Each user shall have a unique ID
•	Each user shall have an associated profile limiting its control over the gateway.
•	A mechanism shall exist to detect malicious attempt to add users.
SR.SGD.User.Management.cloud
SGD-1.0-SR007
It shall be possible to add a new receiving site to the allowed upstream connection of the gateway, (related to SGD-1.0-SR001)
 
Acceptance Criteria:
•	It shall be possible to add a new receiving site based on a unique site ID end a encrypted authorization key.
•	When a new upstream site is added, the registered users and their policy determine the access to the gateway
•	The option to add a new site connection is only enabled when a site has the related permissions

SGD device update mechanisms 

SR.SGD.firmware.update.gateway
SGD-1.0-SR008
It shall be possible to update the firmware of the gateway.
 
Acceptance Criteria:
•	Firmware updates are sent and received encrypted.
•	Encryption is based on unique identifiers of the receiving gateway
•	Received firmware updates are checked by the gateway 
•	In case of noncompliance to set criteria, the firmware update is canceled and a message is sent.
•	During firmware updates the gateway shall not loose connectivity with the backend.
•	During and after upgrade a rollback mechanism shall be possible
SR.SGD.firmware.update.end.node
SGD-1.0-SR008
It shall be possible to update the firmware of an end node
 
Acceptance Criteria:
•	Firmware updates are sent and received encrypted by the gateway.
•	Encryption is based on unique identifiers of the receiving end nodes
•	Received firmware updates are checked by the gateway 
•	In case of noncompliance to set criteria, the firmware update is canceled and a message is sent.
•	During firmware updates the gateway shall not loose connectivity to the end.node
•	During and after upgrade a rollback mechanism shall be possible.
 
SGD Communication

SR.SGD.communication.gateway
SGD-1.0-SR009
All communication between gateway and backend shall be encrypted.
 Acceptance Criteria:
•	It shall not be possible to setup an unencrypted connection with the gateway
•	The gateway shall monitor traffic and alert in situations that there is no encryption.

SR.SGD.communication.end.node
SGD-1.0-SR010
All communication between gateway and end-node should be encrypted
 Acceptance Criteria:
•	An unencrypted connection of an end device with the gateway is isolated?
•	The gateway shall monitor traffic and alert in situations that there is no encryption from a device with encryption enabled in its registered profile.
